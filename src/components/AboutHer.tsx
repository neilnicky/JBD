        On your special day, I wish you all the happiness you truly deserve. May
        your year ahead be filled with joy, laughter, and the courage to chase
        your dreams. As you celebrate, may you be surrounded by love, warmth,
        and all the beautiful moments life has to offer. Happy birthday to
        someone who holds a special place in my heart—may life treat you as
        kindly as you’ve treated those around you. You deserve nothing less than
        a lifetime of happiness, today and always.
